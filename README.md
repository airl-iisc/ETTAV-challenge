# ETTAV EO-IR Object detection challenge

## Overview
Greeting to all the participants, this is the first edition of the challenge hosted by Artificial Intelligence and Robotics laboratory (AIRL) from Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru. You are required to train object detection model using aerial Electro-Optical (EO) images (optionally can use Infrared (IR) images provided with IndraEye dataset) and obtain best predictions on EO and IR test data. This setup is to use EO and IR modalities effectively to generalize object detection models on both domain and varying slant angles without forgetting also adapt from one domain to the other domain effectively.
Whatâ€™s New in This Challenge?

Unlike other simple object detection challenges, this challenge enables participants to work on real-world data i.e, IndraEye which is the only available EO-IR object detection dataset collected using drone in the city of Bengaluru. Achieving better performance on both EO and IR domain enables the use of model in various applications such as traffic management, defense applications, and much more.
How the challenge is important for the participancts?

Win prizes: Certificates and Shoutouts on platforms like LinkedIn and Hugging Face with a chance to feature on our competition blog.
Paper submission: Top two participants will be called to present the work as a paper to the International Conference on Emerging Technology in Autonomous Aerial Vehicles (ETTAV) conference held in IISc Bengaluru (Detail of conference: link).
Boost your portfolio: Showcase your AI & ML skills in real-world object detection.
